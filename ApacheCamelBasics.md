1. Apache Camel is in open source integration framework that enable us to quickly and easily integrate
    the various system consuming and producing data.
2. Apache Camel is open source integration framework based on Enterprise Integration Patterns
3. Apache camel is the industry standard for reducing the boilerplate code for complex integrations -- while maintaining feature like
    Automatic error handling
    Redelivery policies
    The ability to handle complex aggregations

4. **EIP(Enterprise integration pattern)** --> 1. EIP is catalog of design pattern for developing the systems to integrate new and existing
            software in a business env.
           2. EIP provides 65 design patterns and include an icon-based pattern language sometimes called GregorGrams

5. EIP like --> Aggregator , splitter , wiretap(to see the message when sender send to receiver)

**Why Integration Patterns** ?
1.  Different Software has different formats
    JSON, XML, Protocol buffer
2. Point-to-point connection vs Hub vs Spoke
   Point-to-point : expensive
   Hub and spoke : Each new endpoint simply requires a gateway to transform it to canonical model
3. Types
4. Frameworks

**EIP Types -**
1. Messaging System
2. Messaging channels
3. Message Construction
4. Message Routing
5. Message Transformation
6. Message Endpoints
7. System Management
